# Providing a vault

There are 2 kinds of vaults: standard ones (in binary or source form) and tracked ones (only in binary form).

The prerequisites for all vauts are:

- configure the firewall to allow incoming connections on port 5483 for TCP protocol

- for vault at home, configure the ISP box to forward port 5483/TCP to the IP address of the machine that runs the vault.

## Providing a standard vault

### Get binary from Maidsafe release

Download zip file from [Maidsafe release](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_vault/releases/tag/0.17.2) corresponding to
your platform, extract the vault executable and configure it with the set of configuration files defined in
["vaults" directory](https://github.com/Thierry61/tfa_safenetwork/tree/master/vaults).

For example on linux platform:

```bash
# Download zip file
wget https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_vault/releases/download/0.17.2/safe_vault-v0.17.2-linux-x64.zip

# Unzip file
unzip safe_vault-v0.17.2-linux-x64.zip

# Get configuration files
git clone https://github.com/Thierry61/tfa_safenetwork.git

# Configure vault
mkdir app
cd app
cp ../safe_vault-v0.17.2-linux-x64/safe_vault .
cp ../tfa_safenetwork/vaults/*.config .

# Launch vault
RUST_LOG=info ./safe_vault
```

### Compile source from Maidsafe repository

This kind of node is to be build from [safe_vault](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_vault.git) Maidsafe repository
and configured with the set of configuration files defined in
["vaults" directory](https://github.com/Thierry61/tfa_safenetwork/tree/master/vaults).

On a Linux host with rust 1.30.1 (NOT THE LATEST VERSION!):

```bash
# Build vault from Maidsafe source
git clone https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_vault.git
cd safe_vault
cargo build --release

# Get configuration files
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/Thierry61/tfa_safenetwork.git

# Configure vault
mkdir app
cd app
cp ../safe_vault/target/release/safe_vault .
cp ../tfa_safenetwork/vaults/*.config .

# Launch vault
RUST_LOG=info ./safe_vault
```

## Providing a tracked vault

This kind of node is provided in binary form (as a docker image). It uses an out of band network that collects data from
participating vaults. Aggregate data are displayed on [this site](http://116.203.42.154/).

### Install Docker

Install Docker with engine version >= 18.09.0 on a Linux host:

```bash
# Uninstall old version (Itâ€™s OK if apt-get reports that none of these packages are installed)
apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
# Download installer
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
# Install docker
sh get-docker.sh
```

### Start the vault

Then join the network with the following command:

```bash
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3eqzfowpfpsmknaiqitojn560jzfeqapkvgpvy0cj8wqb1oxkw-9up8ds418mt3u03x2wyd9y1ps 116.203.25.212:2377
```

### Define firewall rules

For security reasons you should also set firewall rules to restrict in-going traffic other than ssh, docker and safe_vault.
With ufw package the commands are:

```bash
# Default rules
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
# ssh
ufw allow 22/tcp
# docker
ufw allow 2376/tcp
ufw allow 2377/tcp
ufw allow 4789/udp
ufw allow 7946/udp
ufw allow 7946/tcp
# safe_vault
ufw allow 5483/tcp
# Turn it on
ufw enable
```

### Inscribe your name in the galaxy

To be considered a sponsor and participate in the Honor Roll, provide one or more tracked nodes
on different hosts whose hostname contains a double dash sequence ('--') with a common string before
this sequence. This common string will be your name as a sponsor.
For example with the following hostnames:

- BIGCORP--SW
- BIGCORP--NE

You will be participating as BIGCORP sponsor.

Advantages associated with this title:

- Be listed in the Honor Roll. This list is ordered by decreasing number of nodes, so
  provide many nodes to be ranked at the top of the list
- Show your nodes in the galaxy of constellations
- Monitor your own nodes in the dashboard

### Get the vault logs

By default your vault doesn't show or store any logs. But you can switch it to another mode
where logs are stored in a file by changing log.yml configuration file.

To do that copy with_logs.yml file from ["docker" directory](https://github.com/Thierry61/tfa_safenetwork/tree/master/docker)
in your host and then copy this config file into the running container:
```bash
docker cp with_logs.yml $(docker ps -q):/app/log.yml
```

Start continuous display on screen:
```bash
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q) tail -f safe_vault.log
```

Stop continuous display: ^C

Copy log file from container to host:
```bash
docker cp $(docker ps -q):/app/safe_vault.log .
```

To switch back to no logs mode, copy without_logs.yml file from ["docker" directory](https://github.com/Thierry61/tfa_safenetwork/tree/master/docker)
in your host and then copy this config file into the running container:
```bash
docker cp without_logs.yml $(docker ps -q):/app/log.yml
```

### Stop your vault

To properly stop your vault, issue following command:

```bash
docker swarm leave
```

# Accessing the network from a client

Replace existing crust configuration file with the one in
["clients" directory](https://github.com/Thierry61/tfa_safenetwork/tree/master/clients).

The file is provided for "SAFE Browser". For other clients, just rename it
by replacing "SAFE Browser" part with the base name of the client program.
